## A5: Project Reflection

## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.

When we started the course we used BIM as a Modeller. Now we are closer to Self Learner since we have been able to analyze the problem and teach ourselves to create a code that can solve it. This is only for one use case.

## Your process of developing the tutorial

We are able to define problems that can be solved with OpenBIM tools, but we have gotten very little experience in answering them, and we have only done it for one case. 

The free choice in use case is great for how the course is at the moment, as there are very different levels of experience with coding. For our part, we could possibly have learned more programming with a given use case, as we would have had more time to focus on the programming itself.

The structure of the course and the very quick introduction to new tools and software were quite confusing for us. The structure on Learn could have been more like the traditional structure, otherwise, the structure and format could have been introduced more thoroughly.

## Your received feedback on the tutorial

##### Feedback from Group 40

- The output is very long: Maybe create a summary instead or print what is problematic. Then the entire list of walls can be an option.

- The scope of the project is a little unclear with the difference between the ifc2x3 and 4 file if it is a general issue or just in this case. 

After the feedback, we changed a small thing in the script so you don't have to create a new link to the data model.

## Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

During the course, our knowledge about the possibilities of OpenBIM has been broadened, and the possible use cases are many.

Due to our lack of knowledge and experience with programming, the ideas we wished to execute have been limited. Furthermore, problems with the IFC-file have also limited us and challenged us during the course. 

Despite these challenges, we feel an improvement in our programming skills and our ability to present the intended use of our script.

Both members of this group feel that they are likely to use OpenBIM tools in the future because of the possibilities and efficiency of the tool. With more experience in programming, the tool will hopefully become easier to use as well. 

## Wrap up

From A1 to A5 we definitely have a better idea of how to work with open BIm Tools. The course has for our part been limited by our skills in Python, and that made it more challenging to think more creatively with the use case.
